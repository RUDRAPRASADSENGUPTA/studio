                <p>
                    My practice explores the unstable nature of identity through a constructionist lens, where meaning is not fixed but constantly produced through cultural signs, language, and memory. Identity, for me, is not an essence to be uncovered but a shifting process shaped by systems of power, representation, and social norms. Using second-hand archival images and fragments of childhood memory, I navigate the layered terrain of selfhood, tracing how external forces inscribe meaning onto the body and psyche.
<br><br>The body becomes both a site of performance and resistance, where identity is enacted, disrupted, and renegotiated. Through these gestures and reflections, I confront the impossibility of fully representing the self or the other. Representation can only ever offer fragments, never the whole. This gap is not a limitation, but a space of critical potential.
<br><br>Objects and images in my work function as more than relics; they are charged with symbolic and emotional weight. They allow me to return to the past not in nostalgia, but in search of how meaning is made and unmade. My work ultimately asks how identity can be reimagined when we recognize it as fluid, performative, and always in process.
